Data Structures Implementation: Queues and Linked Lists
This repository contains simple yet fundamental implementations of common data structures in programming, including:

âœ… Queue (Linear Queue)
A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

Supports:

Insertion (Enqueue)

Deletion (Dequeue)

Print (Display queue elements)

âœ… Circular Queue
A queue where the last position connects back to the first, making the structure circular.

Efficiently utilizes storage with wrap-around capability.

Supports:

Insertion (Enqueue)

Deletion (Dequeue)

Print (Display queue elements)

âœ… Singly Linked List
A linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next.

Dynamic memory allocation with efficient insertions and deletions.

Supports:

Insertion at different positions(At Beginning, At Between, At Last)

Deletion of nodes

Print (Traverse and display list)

âœ… Circular Linked List
A linked list where the last node points back to the first node.

Ideal for scenarios requiring continuous traversal.

Supports:

Insertion(At Beginning, At Between, At Last)

Deletion

Print

âœ… Doubly Linked List (Two-Way Linked List)
Each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes.

Allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

Supports:

Insertion(At Beginning, At Between, At Last)

Deletion

Print (Forward and reverse traversal)

ðŸš€ Features:
Basic and clear structure for learning purposes

Manual memory management approach

Console-based programs demonstrating:

Insertion

Deletion

Print/Traversal operations

ðŸ’¡ Ideal For:
Beginners learning data structures

Understanding memory management and pointers

Interview preparation for common technical questions

Soon List and Stack will also added in nthis so be awaited
